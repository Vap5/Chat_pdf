📘 How to Use "Chat PDF"
Welcome! This app lets you ask questions about any PDF file — and get accurate, detailed answers using AI.

🧾 Step-by-Step Instructions
Upload Your PDF(s):

Go to the sidebar on the left

Click "Browse files" and upload one or more PDF documents

Then click the "Process" button to extract and prepare the documents

Ask Your Question:

After processing, go to the main screen

Enter any question related to the content of your PDF (e.g., "What are the main points of chapter 7?" or "What does this contract say about payments?")

View Your Answer:

The app will search the PDF for relevant context

It will then generate a long-form, accurate answer

You’ll also see your chat history to keep track of your questions

🛠 Example Questions You Can Ask:
“Summarize the introduction.”

“What is the conclusion of this report?”

“What are the payment terms mentioned in the contract?”

“List the responsibilities outlined in section 4.”

⚠️ Notes
PDF content should be text-based (scanned images won't work).

You can upload multiple PDFs at once — the app will search across all of them.

Long PDFs may take a few seconds to process.
